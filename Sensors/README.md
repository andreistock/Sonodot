# About



## Usage

First you have to install the [wiringpi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/) library.
After that you can compile the example program *send* by executing *make*. 
You may want to change the used GPIO pin before compilation of the codesend.cpp source file.

## Note
